It's my first day at RC's Summer 2 2018 batch! 
Today I made this website!
I feel like this isn't all that much yet, but it's a start!
This is a really intimidating place, but it's also really exciting.
I'm so blessed and happy that my fiance is here with me.
I'm hoping to put my resume up here and then (ugh) flip all the mentions of my name back to my other name, so I can use it as a professional website. For now it's going to be where I put my daily RC blog posts. 
Rose/Thorn/Bud:
Rose: I *made* something today! I was so worried that I'd be paralyzed by choice but instead I just made a thing! 
Also we all howled at 6 pm and that was fun

Thorn: I kinda lost steam partway through the afternoon, and haven't really put much work into this site. Also I kinda spent a long time today just waiting for someone to help me... but then I decided to help MYSELF and made this website (OH DANG! Looks like this thorn was just a second rose in disguise!!!)

Bud: The people here are so friendly and nice and cool! I'm hoping that I will make some friends here.

Plan for tomorrow: Put my resume on this website, then maybe start spoon game

I'm hungry
