It's week two now. I only made it in for two days on week 1. That's okay. I accomplished a lot last week.
Avni and I have rethought some of the core aspects of spoon game, and are going to give it an exploration/survival aspect, 
and make it about a group of artists trying to make art together. I'm excited about it. 
Also, I made a twitter bot! It's pretty basic right now, but I hope to do more with it when I have more time. 
This week I want to get started with Unity, put more work into spoon game, and maybe start learning Javascript (by making a web game)
Specifically today I want to work with Avni on fixing the latest error with our spoon game engine, and start working through a unity tutorial 
of some sort. I'm also going to participate in post-lunch prep today. 
(a)WOOO!
